Key AI-specific vulnerability types include:
- **Model extraction attacks** that steal proprietary AI models
- **Training data poisoning** that corrupts AI learning
- **Adversarial examples** that trick AI into misclassification
- **Backdoor attacks** embedded during the development pipeline

## Detection Strategies

### Real-Time Monitoring
Implement continuous monitoring systems that can detect unusual AI behavior patterns, including:
- Unexpected output distributions
- Performance degradation anomalies
- Resource consumption spikes
- Model confidence score variations

### Behavioral Analysis
Develop baseline behavioral profiles for AI systems and establish alerting mechanisms for deviations that could indicate compromise.

## Prevention Methodologies

### Secure Development Practices
1. **Model Validation**: Implement rigorous testing protocols for AI models before deployment
2. **Data Integrity**: Establish secure data pipelines with cryptographic verification
3. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls for AI training environments
4. **Version Control**: Maintain detailed audit trails of model changes

### Infrastructure Hardening
